I want you to create few of my webpages with rgb(5, 61, 90) and white theme. Do not generate the whole code at once. Wait till i provide you with the instructions. And do not give whole webpage code at once, i will give you instructions and you will only write code for one section, one by one when i give you instructions for each section seperately turn by turn.

Prompt 2:
